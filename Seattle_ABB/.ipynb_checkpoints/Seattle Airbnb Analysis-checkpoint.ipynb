    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "The main purpose of this project is to explore the dynamics of Seattle Airbnb listings, with a focus on rental prices. On the road to doing this, we will undergo data wrangling, exploratory data analysis and multiple regression analysis. At the end of these project, we will draw conclusions, select the most useful features based on our analyses and propose future areas of improvement. We will answer the following questions about our data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of listing prices in Seattle? Are they mostly cheap or expensive?\n",
    "- What are the average prices of listings by neighbourhood? What are the most expensive and least expensive neighbourhoods in Seattle?\n",
    "- What are the most popular Airbnb room and property types in Seattle? \n",
    "- What listing features would be most helpful if we wanted to predict rental prices?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Variable\n",
    "The target variable for this project is **Rental Price**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin the project, we start by importing the relevant Python modules that will be used."

    "An Adjusted R-squared of 0.584 with a P-value of 0 for each coefficient brings us to our last model adjustment. While more can potentially be done to improve our prediction capabilities (say using another model), that is beyond the scope of this project. With these features though, we are able to explain 58.4% of the variation in Rental Prices through simple linear regression. While this is not perfect, it does at least explain the majority of the variation, and hence is a good predictive starting point."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "With this project, we were able to garner good insights into Airbnb listings. We discovered that most listings were on the more affordable end of prices, while the most expensive listings were a few Boats, Condominiums and Lofts. We also discovered that majority of the listings were Homes and Apartments, and that most times, the Entire Home or Apartment was listed. \n",
    "Finally, we saw that on average, Magnolia and Downtown Seattle have the most expensive listings, while Delridge and Beacon Hill have the most expensive listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Areas of Improvement\n",
    "Evidently, a simple linear regression is not robust enough to predict rental prices accurately, but it is a good starting point. \n",
    "A noteworthy improvement would be incorporating a Sentiment Analysis using renter reviews, and then seeing how Sentiment Scores relate to prices.\n",
    "Another potential improvement would be using a Polynomial Regression to help predict prices. However, this approach would create a relatively higher risk of overfitting, and would need to be carefully regulated. \n",
    "The intention is to implement similar techniques and more in future projects and blogposts."
