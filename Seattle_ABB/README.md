Project: A Data-Dive Into Seattle Airbnb Rentals: End-to-End Data AnalysisÂ¶

Problem Statement


"The main purpose of this project is to explore the dynamics of Seattle Airbnb listings, with a focus on rental prices. On the road to doing this, we will undergo data wrangling, exploratory data analysis and multiple regression analysis. At the end of these project, we will draw conclusions, select the most useful features based on our analyses and propose future areas of improvement. We will answer the following questions about our data:

What is the distribution of listing prices in Seattle? Are they mostly cheap or expensive?
What are the average prices of listings by neighbourhood? What are the most expensive and least expensive neighbourhoods in Seattle?
What are the most popular Airbnb room and property types in Seattle?
What listing features would be most helpful if we wanted to predict rental prices?"


Target Variable - 
The target variable for this project is Rental Price.
